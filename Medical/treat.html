						<h1 style="color:#BF8652;font-size:23px;margin-left:10px;">Diabetes Treatment</h1>
						<p style="margin-top:3px;">Medical science in India has taken rapid as well as big steps forward in past few decades. As a result of that medical facilities in India are at least at par with those of other developed countries, if at all not better than them.<br>
						As a result many treatments of various diseases that were not possible in past are now common over there. For instance diabetes treatment in India was unheard of in past times.<br>
						But before discussing any further on topic of diabetes treatment in India we first have to gain a holistic as well as comprehensive view and knowledge about diabetes and its treatment.<br>
						If one has to define disease of diabetes in a very short as well as succinct manner, then one will have to say simply that diabetes means excess of glucose in blood. This is what common laymen refer to as blood sugar level.<br>
						Treatments to diabetes too are many. In most cases doses of insulin are given in order to rectify problem. This treatment is a bit complicated. But that does not mean that doctors in India will not be able to arrange for diabetes treatment in India for people thronging shores of India in hope that they might get well.<br><br>

						Diabetes treatment in India has become so common that people from outside are coming here to get themselves treated when they can get similarly treated at various medical center near their home. One main and possibly most compelling reason for this might be prohibitively high expenses for health care causes in their own country.<br>
						Due to existing rates of exchange and also because of several other factors, diabetes treatment in India becomes very cheap as compared to other countries. And one can also be easily assured about quality and treatment as well as post operative care.<br><br>
						After having done that they will have to specify and quantify their problems. After treatment is over there are many opportunities for recuperation. And it is for this reason that medical tourism has simply jumped in India and has made it a global player in this field. </p>

There are also several medical institutions that offer neuro surgery in India and specialize in several vascular surgeries such as those for aneurysms of all sizes, arterial bypass, carotid endarterectomy, and other related neuro complications.<br>
						The same also applies for various forms of spinal surgeries. Another reason for such an immense popularity of the neuro surgery in India is the great level of pediatric neurosurgery One may contemplate as to why choose India and travel so long a distance for such a complicated treatment as neuro surgery. The answer is rather simple and obvious. The sudden boom in the health industry of the country has resulted in a huge number of medical practitioners who are highly competent. And the cost involved in eth total treatment too is highly competitive. As a result you need less than 50% of what you would need to spend somewhere else. Hence, neuro surgery in India has turned out to be so popular.</p><br>

						<p style="margin-top:3px;">Eye is one of the most important organs in the body. It is the only source of visual experience. Any kind of Carelessness can be extremely harmful to this vital organ. Therefore whenever you find problems in sighting then you should rush to an eye-specialist without any further delay. But there is one thing that may stop you is the cost of eye treatment. Sad, yet very true. Any ophthalmologist in Europe or America will charge a whopping amount as their bill. Add to that the cost of treatment or surgeries (if required). On the other side of the globe, Eye care India can do the same at remarkably low costs.</p><br>

						<h1 style="color:#BF8652;font-size:23px;margin-left:10px;">Baby Delivery</h1>
						<p style="margin-top:3px;">Pregnancy and childbirth are amongst the commonest things in our lives. These are as common and natural as activities like having food or breathing.<br>
						Yet, when any of our near and dear ones are expecting, most of the time we get rather tense.<br><br>
						There are valid reasons for such a behavior on our part as well. There are statistics that say that about more than 5 lakh women worldwide die due to complexities and abnormalities that arise out of pregnancy per year.<br><br>
						So, it is quite natural that we opt for extra precautionary measures to secure the condition of pregnancy and delivery of a baby. Quite naturally baby delivery in India too is given a lot of seriousness. There are a few issues that form the commonest causes for maternal death.<br><br>
						These are excessive bleeding during childbirth, serious infections, and so on. There are also several cases of abortion where enough safety measures are not taken. As a result, it leads to maternal mortality. Hence it is always wise to get t know about the various available options of baby delivery in India before actually deciding on the issue.<br><br>
						Though the general health condition in India has not yet reached a mark where we can label it as being 'satisfactory', the last few years have seen a great deal of improvement in regard to baby delivery in India. All the hospitals in India have separate maternity sections.<br><br>
						These sections are manned by doctors and assistants who have specialized in pregnancy conditions and are professionals as far as the act of childbirth is concerned. </p>

						<h1 style="color:#BF8652;font-size:23px;margin-left:10px;">Liver Transplant</h1>
						<p style="margin-top:3px;">India is one of the most established healthcare centres in Asia. More and more patients are visiting India for the purpose of medical treatments. A number of vital and major surgeries are carried out in India at remarkably cheaper rates than the west.<br><br>
						It is not just about the cost efficiency, but the healthcare sector in India also offers high quality medical treatment, facilities and services.<br><br>
						The healthcare industry in India is gaining increasing importance due to the high success rate and the growing credibility. Liver transplant in India is one major surgery that has gained immense popularity over the past few years.<br><br>
						Liver transplantation is also referred to as hepatic transplantation. This major surgery involves the replacement of a diseased liver with a healthy liver allograft. The technique that is most commonly used by surgeons to perform liver transplant in India is orthotopic transplantation.<br><br>
						For adults, 73 percent were still alive after five years and 50 percent were still alive after 20 years. “Without a transplant, the five-year survival rates are below 5 percent, depending on the severity of the liver disease,” Dr. Petrowsky said. </p>

						<h1 style="color:#BF8652;font-size:23px;margin-left:10px;">Kidney Transplant</h1>
						<p style="margin-top:3px;">Before starting a very specific discussion on kidney transplantation in India it is essential for all to know what exactly is meant by a kidney transplant procedure. There are certain organs which are present inside our body in pairs such as our eyes lungs and ears.<br><br>
						Similarly in case of kidneys too, we are gifted with a pair. Function of kidneys is to mainly purify a human's blood and help in urine formation.<br><br>
						If one kidney fails then other one can carry on as usual. But problems arise if both of them fail. In that case a surgical process is needed in which a new kidney from a willing donor is used to replace defective kidney.<br><br>
						Main thing that is to be considered is that new kidney should be compatible with patient and this determined by means of blood tests. Now this brings us to discussion of kidney transplantation in India.<br><br>
						Kidney transplantation in India has now become a very common occurrence. This would surprise many who remember India from its olden days.<br><br>
						In older times India was seen as a hell house of diseases which is in stark contrast to image that it carries now which is of a haven of treatment.<br><br>
						But there are certain rules and regulations that govern any treatment or procedure related to kidney transplantation in India. To begin with patient or his or her family will themselves have to find a donor who is willing to donate his or her kidney for operation on patient. Hospitals in India do not take responsibility of locating donors. Next important matter that has to be kept in mind is that it is very much essential to get permission from Government of India before carrying out any kidney transplantation in India over there. And these are the rules, not hurdles in India which has become favorite spot for most medical tourists.  </p>
